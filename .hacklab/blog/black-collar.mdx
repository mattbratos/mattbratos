# Black Collar

For a hundred years, the world had two kinds of workers.

**Blue collar** earned with their hands. Factory floors, construction sites, engine rooms. The name comes from the blue denim and chambray shirts workers wore — dark colors that hid grease and dirt. You showed up, you did physical work, you went home tired.

**White collar** earned with their brains. Offices, cubicles, conference rooms. Named after the white dress shirts required by corporate dress codes. You showed up, you processed information, you went home drained in a different way.

The distinction was clean. Hands vs. brains. Overalls vs. suits. And for most of the 20th century, the path was clear: get educated, move from blue to white, climb the ladder.

Then somewhere in the 2000s, a third class emerged.

## The Hoodie Class

**Black collar** doesn't have a collar at all. They have a hoodie.

They don't need to follow the norms because they're too valuable to be told what to wear. When you can build something in a weekend that a white collar team debates for six months, nobody cares about your dress code.

There's also a practical reason. If you're optimizing for thinking — real, deep, uninterrupted thinking — your clothes need to be as comfortable as possible. A suit is a costume for performing professionalism. A hoodie is a uniform for getting shit done.

The definition is loose, but here's my take: a black collar is someone technically proficient enough to use a CLI, APIs, GitHub, and AI models to build things. A few years ago, this required deep knowledge of how code actually works. Today, it doesn't strictly require that anymore — though most black collars still know their way around a codebase.

The economic line is clear: black collar earns at least 3x the median salary. Often 5-10x.

## Why This Matters Now

White collar is in trouble.

AI is exceptionally good at exactly the things white collar workers do: process information, generate reports, draft emails, analyze data, make recommendations. Every quarterly earnings call now mentions "AI efficiency gains" — which is corporate speak for "we're replacing white collar jobs."

Blue collar is surprisingly safe. Robots still can't fix your plumbing, rewire your house, or navigate a construction site. Physical world complexity is hard to automate.

But black collar? Demand is exploding.

Someone has to build the AI. Someone has to build *with* the AI. Someone has to look at a business problem and translate it into a system that actually works. Someone has to maintain, audit, and evolve these systems once they're running.

AI doesn't replace black collar workers — it makes them more powerful. A single black collar engineer with AI tools can now do what took a team of ten white collar workers and five engineers two years ago.

## The New Earning Model

Blue collar earns with their **hands**.

White collar earns with their **brain**.

Black collar earns with their **taste** and their **agents**.

When AI can write code, generate designs, analyze markets, and draft strategies — the scarce resource isn't intelligence anymore. It's judgment. Knowing what to build. Knowing what matters. Knowing when the AI is wrong.

Taste is the ability to look at ten AI-generated options and pick the one that actually works. It's the ability to define the problem correctly in the first place. It's the ability to say "no" to ninety-nine things so you can say "yes" to the one thing that matters.

And agents — AI agents that work for you, 24/7 — are the new leverage. The black collar worker doesn't just use tools. They deploy autonomous systems. They have a fleet of AI agents writing code, researching markets, monitoring systems, and generating content while they sleep.

## The Great Retraining

Here's the question nobody's asking loudly enough: where do the white collar workers go?

Millions of people spent decades optimizing for the white collar path. Degrees. Certifications. Corporate ladders. And now the rules changed overnight.

Some will adapt. They'll learn to use AI tools, pick up technical skills, and transition to black collar work. The ones who do this fast enough will thrive like never before.

Some won't. And that's the crisis nobody's prepared for.

The education system — built entirely to produce white collar workers — has no idea how to produce black collar ones. Universities still teach you to write memos and make PowerPoints. They don't teach you to ship products, deploy agents, or build systems.

That's the gap. And somebody needs to fill it.
