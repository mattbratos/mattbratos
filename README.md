## 🌟 Projects

### UMate

- 📅 **Year:** 2022-2023
- 🛠 **Tech Stack:** Figma, UX/UI Principles
- 🚀 **Why:** I couldn't stand using terrible university software from 20 years ago. To navigate our uni, we had to use 13 different apps, and every one of them was unusable. So, I decided to create one "Student Life OS". I took Google's UX/UI bootcamp, learned Figma, designed a prototype, and pitched it to my University management. They weren't interested and told me that I would never get this deal and shouldn't even try (their exact words), so I decided to build something next. But this whole experience made me realize how slow, lazy, and inefficient these giant institutions are, and how deeply they don't care about their users. That's why I decided to build Homebrew College Club, an open-source alternative to higher education.

### Portfolio

- 📅 **Year:** 2023-2024
- 🛠 **Tech Stack:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js
- 🚀 **Why:** To show my progress from plain HTML and CSS to React and Next. It also keeps me motivated to build projects from Scrimba's frontend Path.

### Hack Me Hard

- 📅 **Year:** 2024
- 🛠 **Tech Stack:** NextJS
- 🚀 **Why:** We had to build and pitch an educational game as a uni project.

### Homebrew College Club

- 📅 **Year:** 2023-2024
- 🛠 **Tech Stack:** NextJS
- 🚀 **Why:** Higher education is extremely overpriced, outdated, yet almost essential for succeeding in life (at one point, I was a 17-year-old high school dropout following Peter Thiel's advice, trying to build a startup, so I know life without formal education). I wrote a dissertation called "Can AI Teach Better Than Harvard?" and built a super simple, unscalable MVP for that, and it significantly outperformed Harvard in teaching basic Python concepts. You can see it and use it here: Now I'm building a scalable MVP 2.0 where users can add their own content. Launch soon! Hopefully before the YC summer batch deadline (22 April).
