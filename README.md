# 👋 yo, I’m matt

I'm on a mission to build a free online university 100x better than harvard → [homebrew hackers club](https://homebrew.so)

- 💻 vybe coder
- ⚙️ trying to build useful shit
- 💥 i believe education is the cornerstone of society — fix it, and hackers will fix everything else

### what I'm working on now:
- 🛠 shipping v1 of homebrew
- 📹 documenting the journey (aka making content about building a startup)
- 🏃 training for a sub-3h marathon

### fun facts:
- 🏋️ deadlift 200kg, bench press 120kg, squat 140kg
- 🇺🇸 now in warsaw, soon in san francisco
- 🤖 obsessed with hacking, philosophy, and capitalism
